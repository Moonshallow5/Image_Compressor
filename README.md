# Image_Compressor


## ðŸ’¡What's this project about

So, I wanted to learn more about Unsupervised Learning, having already completed a Coursera course on the basics of Machine Learning, making a simple K-means clustering program was an ideal way to further my Machine Learning Journey.


## ðŸ”§How this project works?

Need an image which you can compress? In this program, you can upload an image and we will compress it for you

The K-means clustering is currently fixed on K=... and number of iterations as ... thus due to K in being a fixed value there will always only be .. many colours in the image


## ðŸš§Challenges faced

The code for producing the K-means clustering was code from a Jupyter Notebook from Coursera's Machine Learning Specialization, but integrating it into my Flask project took a lot of time, as well as learning the documentation for tailwind.css and how to upload images into Flask


## ðŸ‘€Future Implementations

- Be able to compress PNG files and not just JPEG
- Be able to use some image augmentation functions to increass quality of image while still making the image small in size
- Be able to vary the amount of K and number of iteration for best image quality to file size
